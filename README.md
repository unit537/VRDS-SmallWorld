# VRDS-SmallWorld 

VRDS-SmallWorld is a python command-line utility to read \*.ydk files and find all possible routes for Small World

**FOR INITIAL RELEASE: Name your deck file `deck.ydk` and place it in the same folder as `SmallWorldRouteFinder.py`**

This will be updated to read in decks from a dir and allow you to select your deck at a later date <sub><sup>No ETA for that though, but soon</sup></sub>:tm:

When running the app via commandline, you will be prompted to search routes based on the Starter card or the Target card.

## The format for the route is as follows:

Starter   >   Bridge    >   Target

Starter: The card you reveal in hand

Bridge: The card you choose from the deck

Target: The card you add to your hand
